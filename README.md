Hello, thank you for reviewing my repository and leaving the valuable feedback! It was very helpful and cool to learn about adding the streamlit checkboxes into columns for better viewing. I fixed the inefficiencies in the code that were identified and address the critical issue of adding in the introduction and outline in the notebook. Additionally, I added a few more graphs detailing the distribution of 4wd vehicles after I added in the boolean dtype. Thank you again for your time, I hope you enjoy!
